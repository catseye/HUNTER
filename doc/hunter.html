<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>To quote <a href="hunter.txt">hunter.txt</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>"It is perceived that one of the biggest problems in maintaining
interest in programming is the above linear growth of boredom
compared to the usefulness of the program, resulting in an
acute loss of enthusiasm on the part of the programmers and
ultimately the abandonment of the software.</p>

<p>"This document intends to address that by introducing a language
with new models for sharing, flow control, and data manipulation,
which make all dependencies in a program globally accessible and
radically oblique at the language level.</p>

<p>"We introduce the language, which is a deterministic particle
automaton based on mazespace-rewriting and critter-style message
passing and, being ASCII art, is inherently graphical in notation..."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The Perl 5 implementation of HUNTER requires the
<a href="/projects/virtcons/">_Console::Virtual
module</a>.</p>
